# Zero Trust Architecture Blog Series

This branch is the starting point for our app that we dicsuss in the blog series.

To run it locally, you'll need Docker for the MongoDB portion and NPM for the server/client part.

Do the normal Node.js prep stuff, start the MongoDB container and run:

```npm start dev```


The other branches represent how the application looks as we progress through the process of employing Zero Trust Architecture concepts.
